                    With the new knowledge of webrtc I decided to build a simple online multi-player game. I make use
                    of webpack to ensure that the data I send doesn't go over the limit of webrtc message. The
                    game does not require a server. The player's browsers communicate with one another.

                    Little demo I've build to try out WebRTC DataChannel. Each time someone visits the page a random
                    string is generated. When a second person enters the page with the same random string then they'll
                    join the fun.

                    Dungeons and Dragons character sheet I've built for my friends to use while we play.
                    It's an Electron app built using React and Redux. All the UI is created using SVGs generated from
                    the original D&D character sheet PDF. I can do some pretty cool things with DOM manipulations on inline svg elements.

                <p>A fun little exercise I prepared to show school kids the capabilities of python.
                Its a Snake Game with build in autopilot using A* path finding algorithm. The A* algorithm
                is not working fully because it doesnâ€˜t take in account where the tail will be after each
                    move which can cause the snake to trap itself. Its still fun to watch the snake find its way to apples.
