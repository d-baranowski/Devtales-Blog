            <p>My name is Daniel. I'm a Computer Science Graduate and professional software developer. For the entirety of my career I have been
                working as part of small tightly knit teams where engineers are expected to pick up different roles
                depending on circumstances. I thrive in these kind of environments as I enjoy learning new skills to
                solve problems at hand.
                My work experience is mainly in consultancies, where writing clean robust and testable code is part
                of the culture. I care deeply about the quality of my work and continuously educate myself to follow
                highest standards. I worked with object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C# and
                gained experience with other paradigms while programming in Node and GoLang.
                I am passionate about my work and often go the extra mile, learning new things which will benefit
                the projects I work on.</p>
