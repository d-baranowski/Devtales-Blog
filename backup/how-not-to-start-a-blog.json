I stay reasonable when working on real projects, so I decided to let go when working on the blog in my spare time. Following this 'logic', when I was faced with a challenge of writing a blog with 99% of static content React was an obvious choice. I did consider using server side rendered templates using Thymeleaf or other similar technologies, but that would be boring and no one likes boring projects. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"e6crg\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"62q8u\",\"text\":\"Since I was using React I really needed to make it a polymorphic application.

This approach will lead to code that is difficult to maintain, as it violates the DRY principle.

As I was adding code I was growing more eager to write blog posts. At first It was great! I was learning new things and discovering interesting solutions to various problems.

I didn't only have to write code that will work when rendered on the server, but I also had to make the same code provide the same functionality when ran solely on the client. As requirements grew more complicated, so did my ORM code. I found that I was spending more time writing my ORM implementation than I was on actual implementation code for the blog. When It comes to Nashorn, it turned out to be worryingly slow and impossible to debug.
