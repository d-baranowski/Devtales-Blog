Unfortunately it also adds unnecessary layers of complexity. In order to have asynchronous behaviour in Redux  you'll need to write a lot of code. In a world where everything is asynchronous I've had enough of confusing middle-wares, numerous action creators and obscure yield operators. In this article I'll demonstrate how simple async operations can become without Redux.</span></span></div></div><br><div class=\"summary\"><div class=\"public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\"><span><br></span></div></div><br>",
