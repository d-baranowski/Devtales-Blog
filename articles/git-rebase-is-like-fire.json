After gaining experience using git someone else told me to use it. At first I tough it was blasphemy even to mention this command. However after giving it a try I could no longer live without it. It lets me keep my commit history clean and therefore much more useful. \\nThe danger that everyone talks about is the fact that this command rewrites history and generates new git commit tags for rebased commits. This means that if you are working on the same branch as someone else you should not rebase it because it will make it really hard to resolve git conflicts. \\nImagine you have the same commit duplicated locally on your machine and your coworkers machine. If you rebase and try to merge your changes with your co-worker's, git has no way of identifying that your version of commit is the same as your friend's version. Its id has been changed. Keep this in mind when you use rebase. You should use it on personal feature branches, but if you need to do this on a shared branch make sure that everyone is aware that you plan to do this and that everyone's changes are securely merged before proceeding. This means that rebasing master is almost never a good idea. \\n\",\n      \"type\": \"unstyled\",\n      \"depth\": 0,\n      \"inlineStyleRanges\": [\n        {\n          \"offset\": 80,\n          \"length\": 9,\n          \"style\": \"BOLD\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"offset\": 364,\n          \"length\": 6,\n          \"style\": \"BOLD\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"offset\": 569,\n          \"length\": 21,\n          \"style\": \"BOLD\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"entityRanges\": [],\n      \"data\": {}\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"7ofqm\",\n      \"text\": \"A good commit\",\n      \"type\": \"header-two\",\n      \"depth\": 0,\n      \"inlineStyleRanges\": [],\n      \"entityRanges\": [],\n      \"data\": {}\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"9ghc2\",\n      \"text\": \"A good commit history is invaluable for maintainability of a project.
